## Competitive Positioning

| Competitor | Their Model | Our Advantage |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| **IBM MQ** | Proprietary, expensive | Open-source core, 10x cheaper |
| **SWIFT SDK** | Official but limited | Multi-format, modern stack |
| **In-house** | Custom development | Maintained, community-tested |
| **Other OSS** | Limited formats | Complete banking coverage + COBOL |

## Key Success Metrics

### Open-Source Metrics
- GitHub stars: 1,000+ in Y1
- npm downloads: 10,000+/month
- Contributors: 50+
- PRs merged: 200+

### Business Metrics
- Conversion rate: 5% OSS → Paid
- CAC: <$5,000
- LTV: >$150,000
- Gross margin: >85%

## Risk Mitigation

### IP Protection
1. **Clear boundaries**: Parser only in OSS
2. **Trademark**: "SwiftParser" registered
3. **CLA**: All contributors sign
4. **Audit trail**: Document prior art

### Competition Response
1. **If SWIFT releases OSS**: Focus on multi-format
2. **If banks collaborate**: Join as contributor
3. **If copied**: Enforce trademarks, out-innovate

### Technical Risks
1. **Format changes**: Modular architecture
2. **Security issues**: Rapid patch process
3. **Scaling**: Cloud-native design
